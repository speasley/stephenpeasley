    <h1>Hi, I&rsquo;m Stephen.</h1>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;m a freelance web developer, UX designer, and actor. A classic
      triple threat. I live in Mohkinstsis/Calgary.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was born and raised in Saskatchewan, on the mean streets of Humboldt. I
      shifted west in 2007. I love collaborating with other creative and
      passionate people. I value early collaboration, brainstorming, and a
      thoughtful approach. I also value good humour, good crosswords, and good
      health.
    </p>
    <p>I aim to leave things better than how I found them.</p>
