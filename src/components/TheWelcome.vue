    <h1>Hi, I&rsquo;m Stephen.</h1>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;m a freelance web developer, designer, and actor. A classic triple

      I was born and raised in Saskatchewan, on the mean streets of Humboldt. I

      passionate people. I value early collaboration, brainstorming, and a
      thoughtful approach. I also value good humour, good crosswords, and good
